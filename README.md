# Tennessee_Real_Estate
In this project, I employ MySQL for data cleansing and exploration, aiming to derive insights from the Tennessee housing market. This project make extensive use of advanced tools such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Window Functions, and Aggregate Functions to handle complex queries and data analysis efficiently. With the exploration process, for instance, I looked at net profit and land value of properties and developed a program using stored procedure to calculate the Return on Investment (ROI) for properties using Parcel ID as the input.
To further provide insights, I extracted data to Tableau to create a dashboard as below: ( [Tableau Visualizations
